                  Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, (officially
                  BS OHSAS 18001) is an internationally applied British Standard
                  for occupational health and safety management systems. Falcon
                  will be upgrading this accreditation in the second quarter of
                  2019 to the latest version which will become ISO45001:2018.
                  Like the other accreditations it provides a framework to
                  identify, control and decrease the risk associated with health
                  and safety within the work place. Our aim is to reduce the
                  likelihood of accidents and incidents and demonstrate a sound
                  occupational health and safety performance. The accreditation
                  lets our customers know that, in Falcon, we are serious about
                  safety within the organisation, thus making our organisation a
                  safer place in which to work.
